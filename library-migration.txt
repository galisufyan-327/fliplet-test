First of all I will evaluate the changes from current version to newer then
install newer version with some alias to be able to use both until all the changes are done

- Take the smallest possible migration and model and start converting it
- Test all the changes one by one
- Commit the changes one by one to be able to rollback quickly if something went wrong
- I will include some sort of error and reporting tool just to be sure that everything will go smoothly
